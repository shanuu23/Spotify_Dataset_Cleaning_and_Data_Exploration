# 🎧 Spotify Dataset Cleaning and Data Exploration

This project involves cleaning and analyzing a Spotify dataset to uncover insights about track,genre, and playlists popularity.

What I Did:
    Cleaned the dataset: removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
    Ensured each track appears in only one playlist to avoid duplication in analysis.

Identified:
    1) Top 5 playlists by average track popularity.
    2) Most popular genre and subgenre in each playlist.
    3) Top song (with artist and popularity score) from each playlist’s top subgenre.
    4) Albums with the most hit tracks by count.

📊 Visualizations:
1) Created bar charts and other plots to visualize:
    a) Track popularity across top playlists.
    b) Genre and subgenre distributions.

📌 Future Work:
    1) More in-depth audio feature analysis (e.g., tempo, danceability).
    2) Cluster analysis to group similar playlists or tracks.
    3) Interactive dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit.
